# Spooktober 2021 Hackathon Dev Day

## Structure:

- At 9:00am you can form teams and start your project

- At 4:00pm we will gather in the Microsoft Teams meeting. From there, groups will have the opportunity to present their projects. This is an optional presentation and you are not required to show anything if you choose. Try to keep presentations to under 5 minutes in order to give the opportunity for everyone to present.

## Tips:
- Don't be too ambitious. You have a very limited to develop a solution, so focus on finishing your main feature first before adding additional features.

- If working with new/unfamiliar technologies, start small so that you have time to learn.

- If working in a team of more than one person, you can often get more done by evenly dividing up the work.


## Rules:
- Participants must work on a team from one (1) to four (4) people. Individuals may not work on multiple teams.

- Each team with more than one person should have a name.

- You can use any language or technology to develop a solution

- Do not use any company (FCC/Devpro/etc.) technology or data
